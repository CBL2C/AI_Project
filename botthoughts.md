 - This file is intended as a loose freeform idea chain for bot planning and architecture. 

 - Bot Goals: Intake and train on a dataset of fiction literature. Upon user interaction, output an "original" written response based on user-driven prompts.

 - Bot needs: Frontend, Backend, Bot(M-LA), prepared training data.  

 - Frontend: React
 - Backend: Node
 - Bot: GPT-2 is paid, but I would like to avoid that solution if possible. A free and open-source machine-learning algorithm will need to be trained on custom data that has been prepeared and cleaned. 

 - Other thoughts: because this is a small project with two people I'd like to propose training the algorithm on children's books: Where the Wild things Are, I am Enough, The Very Hungry Catepillar, Goodnight Moon, etc. 

 - Childen's books are low-complexity but impart social, ethical, amd moral standards of behavior. They socialize young children and prime them for interaction with the world. These books also employ repetition, rhyming, and simplistic language that is nonetheless direct and effective communication. I believe all these traits make children's books good candidates for a first attempt at training an AI on a dataset and properly prepring that data. 

 - Additionally, if this bot manages to write an awesome new original childen's book there's always publishing it and splitting the royalties :)
